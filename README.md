# matthakar_data_cleaning_and_visualization

The purpose of this Python script is to pull Amazon footwear price information for the top-rated shoes (>= 4 stars) and visualize some of the data.

The dataset used for this script can be found here: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/lokeshparab/amazon-products-dataset?resource=download

This script is split into three separate parts. It can be run at once or in separate segments when modifying the data analysis/visualization outputs to save on runtime.

Part 1. Collate Amazon product files into one df
Part 2. Clean and reformat the collated_df to create the shoes_df
Part 3. Further clean data and visualize price data from the shoes_df
